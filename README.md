# Web Worker Project

## Description
This project implements Web Workers in a JavaScript application to perform heavy data processing tasks in the background, thereby improving performance and user experience.

## How to Run the Project Locally
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory in your code editor.
3. Run an HTTP server locally (e.g., using `http-server` or `live-server`).
4. Open the browser and navigate to the local server URL to view the project.

## Performance Improvements with Web Workers
Using Web Workers allows the application to offload heavy data processing tasks to separate threads, preventing UI blocking and enhancing responsiveness. By leveraging parallelism, Web Workers significantly improve the performance of the application, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex calculations.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions
1. **Understanding Web Workers**: Initially, understanding the concept and implementation of Web Workers posed a challenge. To overcome this, I thoroughly studied the documentation and experimented with simple examples to grasp the fundamentals.
   
2. **Communication between Main Thread and Web Workers**: Establishing communication between the main thread and Web Workers required careful handling of messages. I resolved this challenge by defining clear message protocols and using appropriate event handlers (`onmessage` and `postMessage`) to exchange data.

3. **Testing and Debugging**: Testing and debugging Web Workers posed challenges due to their separate execution contexts. To address this, I utilized browser developer tools to inspect worker threads, console.log statements, and unit tests to ensure correct functionality.
